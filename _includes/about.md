# About me
I was born in **Spain**.
### I'm a software developer at [Delonia](https://delonia.com)
a small software consultancy in Madrid. Mostly doing frontend with React, backend with Java and some devops.
### I study Electronic Engineering at Universidad Polit√©cnica de Madrid.
In Spain there are two branches of Electronic Engineering: one focused on **Telecommunications** and other focused on Industrial applications. I study the former.
### I'm interested in:
- Distributed systems
- Decentralisation

Currently I am experimenting running my own Matrix server and bridges to all platforms.
