# About me

I was born in Spain. Currently I'm a software developer at Delonia, a company in Madrid.

I study Electronic Engineering at Universidad Polit√©cnica de Madrid. In Spain there are two branches of Electronic Engineering: one focused on <strong>Telecommunications</strong> and other focused on Industrial applications. I study the former.

I'm interested in:
- Distributed systems
- Decentralisation

Currently I am experimenting running my own Matrix server and bridges to all platforms.
